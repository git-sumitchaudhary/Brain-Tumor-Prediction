# 🧠 Brain Tumor Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on **detecting the presence of brain tumors from medical images** using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and an interactive **Gradio-based web interface** for real-time predictions.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the end-to-end workflow of an ML-based medical image classification system, making it suitable for **academic projects, portfolio building, and ML learning purposes**.
